# ODSLib
ODSLib is a C++ template library for some basic algorithms on orbital dynamics 
and safety (ODS), such as some astronomical constants, transformation between 
varies coordinates and elements, and integrators.

- Constants
- Coordinate transformation
- Distance between ellipsoids
- Integrator


## Dependences
- Eigen3 library: a C++ template library for linear algebra: matrices, vectors, 
numerical solvers, and related algorithms.


## Requirements
It should work on Windows, Linux, OS X.
For now it is only tested for gcc (6.3.0) and clang (3.8.1).
MSVC will be tested in future.


## Installation
Just include "ODSLib/ODSLib.h" in the project.


## Quick Start
Examples can be found in "MainRun.cpp".
